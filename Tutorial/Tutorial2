Input the BasicMovement.png which contains 36 images. 
From tutorial 1: Click on the image and change the setting Filter Mode to Point (no filter) and the setting Compression to None.
Click apply. Also change Sprite Mode to Multiple and click Apply. 
Then click the Sprite Editor button -> Slice -> Grid By Cell Size. 
The X and Y Pixel Size will vary by the dimensions of the sprite sheet being used,
but for this one X=77 and Y=77 works. 
Click Slice then Apply, and exit out of the Sprite Editor. 

From tutorial 1: Click the BasicMovement_2 cube again and at the top left click Window -> Animation -> Animation. 
Click RunLeft in the Animation window and Create New Clip in the Animations folder called "RunLeftDown."
Select and drag BasicMovement_12-17 into the Animation window, and change Samples to 12.
Make sure that the animation is set to Loop Time. 
(There might be size inconsistencies from the images used in tutorial 1.
Simply replace the images from tutorial 1 with the images from this new sprite sheet
by clicking and dragging images 0-5 into RunLeft and 6-11 into RunRight.)
Also repeat this process by creating animations RunRightDown (with images 18-23), RunLeftUp (with images 24-29), and RunRightUp (with images 30-35).

Go to the Animator tab and delete the RunLeft, RunRight, RunLeftDown, RunRightDown, RunLeftUp, and RunRightUp boxes. 
Right click -> Create State -> From New Blend Tree. 
Rename it to "Run" and double click the box. 
Click the Blend Tree box and make sure that its Blend Type is 1D.
In the Motion list, click + and Add Motion Field. Click the circle in the field and select the RunLeft animation.
Repeat the above step and select the RunRight animation.

Add a second Float and call it "Vertical."
Remove RunLeft and RunRight from the Motion list by selecting each and clicking - for each.
Change the Blend Type to 2D Simple Directional. 
Add the animations to the Motion list in this order: RunRight, RunRightUp, RunLeftUp, RunLeft, RunLeftDown, RunRightDown.
Set the second Parameter to Vertical. 
Set the Pos X and Pos Y for each motion: RunRight is (1,0), RunRightUp is (0.5,0.866), RunLeftUp is (-0.5,0.866),
RunLeft is (-1,0), RunLeftDown is (-0.5,-0.866), and RunRightDown is (0.5,-0.866). 
Create another Float and call it "Magnitude."
Go back to the Base Layer of the Animator, right click Idle and Make Transition to Run.
Click on the arrow which appears between them, uncheck Has Exit Time, uncheck Fixed Duration, and set Transition Duration to 0. 
Click the + to add a condition to the Conditions list, make the condition Magnitude greater than 0.
Then Make Transition from Run to Idle, uncheck Has Exit Time, uncheck Fixed Duration, and set Transition Duration to 0.
Add the condition Magnitude less than 0.001 to it. 

See the updated BasicMovement.cs script in folder 2 of this repository.
You should be able to click the Play arrow and watch the sprite animations as you move it around!
