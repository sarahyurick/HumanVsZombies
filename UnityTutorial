In the Unity Hub, create a new 2D game. 
Do File -> New Scene, then File -> Save Scenes, call it "BasicMovementAndAnim" and save it in the Scenes folder. 
You can change the background color of the scene by clicking the Main Camera cube (cubes are under the Hierarchy tab). 
You can also change the Size of the Main Camera (you'll later see that a bigger number makes the character smaller).
You can also see that Unity has 3 tabs: Scene, Game, and Asset Store. 
Click on Game to see the actual game scene and see that the background color has updated. 

You can find a PNG "exampleSpriteSheet.png" in this repository. 
Right click the Assets folder in Unity and create a new folder in it called "Graphics."
Click and drag exampleSpriteSheet into the Graphics folder. 
Click on the image and change the setting Filter Mode to Point (no filter) and the setting Compression to None. Click apply. 
Also change Sprite Mode to Multiple and click Apply. 
Then click the Sprite Editor button -> Slice -> Grid By Cell Size. 
The X and Y Pixel Size will vary by the dimensions of the sprite sheet being used,
but for exampleSpriteSheet X=188 and Y=205 works. 
Click Slice then Apply, and exit out of the Sprite Editor. 
We have multiple sprite images now!

Now switch to the Scene tab, click and drag a single sprite image (I did exampleSpriteSheet_2) to where the camera icon is, 
and now switch back to the Game tab to see the sprite on the board. 
For aesthetic purposes, I changed the background color in Main Camera to match the background color of the sprite sheet,
but ideally when we're actually making the game we're dealing with transparent images. 

Under Assets, create another folder called Scripts. 
In scripts, right click and create a new C# file, call it something like "BasicMovement."
See my BasicMovement.cs script in this repository to get a general idea of how to code that. 

Back in Unity, click the exampleSpriteSheet_2 cube, 
which should have appeared in the Hierarchy under Main Camera when you dragged the image onto the scene. 
Click and drag your saved C# script to the blank area under the Add Component button, 
and you should see it appear there.
Now you can click the Play arrow at the top middle of Unity and move the character around!
